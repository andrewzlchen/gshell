# gshell

gshell, or GoShell is a small shell project that I am buildin throughout the summer. The plan is to implement some commands whenever I have the time and slowly increase the complexity of this project. The goal is to try and make this shell as full-featured as possible.

Contributions are also welcome!

## How to Contribute

If you want to implement a command, please create an issue, and I'll to reply and give the okay.

Tests would be nice.

So far, this project is basically vanilla go, so once you clone this, it should be go to go. (pun intended.)
