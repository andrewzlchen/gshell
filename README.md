# gshell

gshell, or GoShell is a small shell project that I am building throughout the summer. The plan is to implement some commands whenever I have the time and slowly increase the complexity of this project. The goal is to try and make this shell as full-featured as possible while not just `exec`ing (This may change in the future).

Contributions are also welcome!

## Feature Checklist

- [x] ls: List files in current directory
- [ ] ls \<path\>: List files at directory
- [ ] cd \<path\>: Change directory
- [ ] cat \<file\>: Print contents of file to stdout

## How to Contribute

If you want to implement a command, please create an issue, and I'll to reply and give the okay.

Tests would be nice.

So far, this project is basically vanilla go, so once you clone this, it should be good to go. (pun intended.)
